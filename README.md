  Generate a binary tree with ~10 random nodes instantly.  

- **Five Animated Traversals**  
  Visualize with smooth animations:  
  - Preorder  
  - Inorder  
  - Postorder  
  - Level Order  
  - Spiral Order  

- **Traversal Output**  
  Display traversal results in a styled box with arrow notation (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3`).  

- **Responsive UI**  
  Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes using **Tailwind CSS** grid utilities and SVG scaling.  

- **Error Handling**  
  Prevents duplicate values and invalid actions (e.g., traversal on an empty tree).

  Built with **Framer Motion** for highlighting, scaling, and fade-in effects.
